    "## Dataset splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning is about creating models that precisely map the given inputs (independent variables, or **predictors**) to the given outputs (dependent variables, or **responses**).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand that you can't use the same data for training and testing the model, because that evaluation would be biased (meaning that you have to test with fresh data to properly assess if the model performs similarly with both datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the road of creating your model, you'll have to fit it (aka train it); another advantage of splitting data in two datatsets is that it allows to detect if your model is **underfitting** (the model is unable to create correlations between your data points, i.e. is non-linear) or **overfitting** (the model has such liberty that it creates corelations that should not exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferably, there should be three datasets: **training** (used to train or fit your model), **validation** (used for hyperparameter tuning of your model, i.e. experimenting with different options to find the best outcome possible) and **testing** (as the name implies, to finally test your model with fresh data).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to do this is by splitting the original dataset, and one particular package can help you with that task: `sklearn`."

    "* `test_size` is the number that defines the size of the test set. It’s very similar to train_size. You should provide either train_size or test_size. If neither is given, then the default share of the dataset that will be used for testing is 0.25, or 25 percent.\n",
