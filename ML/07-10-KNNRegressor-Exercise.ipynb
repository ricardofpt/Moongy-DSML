    "This exercise uses the **bike sharing** dataset. The function of all features as well as the target is described in the **Readme.txt** file. The goal is to predict the count of total rental bikes using KNN's regressor and the OLS linear regression implemented in sklearn.\n",

    "The code implemented below reads the **day.csv** file located in the **data/bike-sharing-dataset** folder and stores the data in a **pandas** DataFrame. Some of the columns are omitted. The goal of predicting the count can be achieved by following the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the OLS assumptions is that each feature bears a linear dependency with the target. To check whether this condition is satisfied, create separate plots of **cnt** versus each of the six features. Choose two that bear a linear, or close to linear, dependency with the target.\n",
    "* Let these two features be the inputs and **cnt** be the target.\n",
    "* Create an 80:20 train-test split.\n",
    "* Having the features scaled is an essential part of working with the KNN algorithm. Make sure that the two features are scaled properly. You can use sklearn's StandardScaler() class.\n",
    "* Create instances of the KNeighborsRegressor and LinearRegression classes. For the KNeighborsRegressor model, try to find the number of neighbors that works best.\n",
    "* Fit the model to the training data.\n",
    "* Make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "* For each of the models, make a plot of the true test values versus the predicted test values. A perfect model would draw a 45-degree line. On both figures, plot a 45-degree line for a reference.\n",
    "* Return the R-squared value for both models. You can find out how to do that on the pages of the two regression algorithms. What is the R-squared value of a perfect model? Based on that, which of the two models performed better?\n",
