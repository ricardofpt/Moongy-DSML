    "group by category\n",
    "order by total desc;\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since our view was built to always have up to date data, if you try to execute the second query above, you'll get this result: `Result: 16 rows returned in 14543ms`\n",
    "\n",
    "That's too much time to get 16 rows! So here's another cool feature: temporary tables. Just run the sql below to create one from our view:\n",
    "\n",

    "create temporary table temp as\n",
    "    select * from joined_data;\n",

    "from temp \n",
    "group by category\n",
    "order by total desc;\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "That's more like it: `Result: 16 rows returned in 106ms`\n",
    "\n",
